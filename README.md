# pyBackPropNets
In this project you can find microTensorFlow.py it is a little library that allows build Deep Neural Networks with different loss.
To use it just download and put on your working directory.
There are three examples: A linear classificator, A one layer neural network and a Naive Recurrent Network.
It is a work in progres.
